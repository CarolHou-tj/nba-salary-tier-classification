title: "NBA Player Salary Prediction (2022-23 Season)"

## üìå Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between **NBA player performance** and their **salary tiers** using data from the 2022-23 season.  
Instead of predicting exact salary amounts, we grouped players into salary ranges (Budget, Mid-Tier, Upper Mid-Tier, Premium).  
We built and compared multiple machine learning models to evaluate their ability to classify players into the correct salary tier.

**Key Objectives:**
- Predict salary groups rather than exact amounts to reduce the impact of outliers.  
- Help teams, scouts, and agents assess relative player value for strategic decisions.  
- Apply multiple classification methods and identify the best-performing model.

## üìä Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle NBA Player Salaries 2022-23 Season](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
- **Entries:** 467 players  
- **Selected Features:**  
  - Assists (AST)  
  - Steals (STL)  
  - Blocks (BLK)  
  - Turnovers (TOV)  
  - Personal Fouls (PF)  
  - Points (PTS)  
  - Salary Group (target variable)

**Salary Groups:**
- **Budget Tier:** Bottom 25%  
- **Mid-Tier:** 25%‚Äì50%  
- **Upper Mid-Tier:** 50%‚Äì75%  
- **Premium Tier:** Top 25%  

**Data Split:** Stratified sampling with `createDataPartition()` to preserve class distribution across training/testing sets.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Models Applied
We evaluated the following models with **cross-validation and parameter tuning**:

| Model                  | Accuracy | Key Findings |
|-------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Logistic Regression     | 41.3%    | Assists negatively correlated with higher salary groups; points and blocks strong predictors of Premium. |
| LDA                     | 45.65%   | Better for extreme groups (Budget & Premium), struggles with overlapping mid-range classes. |
| QDA                     | 47.1%    | Flexible but prone to overfitting; poor at mid-range classification. |
| KNN (k=11)              | 45.7%    | Captures non-linear relationships, but misclassifies Mid & Upper Mid Tiers. |
| Decision Trees (size=6) | **55.03%** | Best performance; key splits on points, fouls, and assists; risk of overfitting. |
| SVM (radial, C=1, Œ≥=0.5)| 50.67%   | Poor sensitivity for mid-tier groups. |

## üèÜ Results
- **Decision Trees** performed the best with ~55% accuracy.  
- Most models struggled with **Mid-Tier and Upper Mid-Tier groups** due to feature overlap.  
- **Points** and **assists** consistently emerged as strong predictors across models.
